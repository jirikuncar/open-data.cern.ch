    <h2>CERN Open Data Portal</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      The CERN Open Data portal is the access point to a growing range
      of data produced through the research performed at CERN. It disseminates the preserved
      output from various research activities, including accompanying software and
      documentation which is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portal adheres to established global standards in data
      preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they
      are issued with a digital object identifier (DOI) to make them citable objects in
      the scientific discourse (see details below on how to do this).
    </p>

    <h3>Data and re-use</h1>

        <h4>LHC Data</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          Data produced by the LHC experiments are usually
          categorised in four different levels (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0255">DPHEP
          Study Group (2009)</a>). The Open Data portal focuses on the release of
          data from level 2 and 3.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Level 1 data comprises data that is directly related to publications which
            provide documentation for the published results
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 2 data includes simplified data formats for analysis in outreach and
            training exercises
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 3 data comprises reconstructed data and simulations as well as the
            analysis level software to allow a full scientific analysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 4 covers basic raw level data (if not yet covered as level 3 data) and
            their associated software and allows access to the full potential of the
            experimental data
          </li>

        <h4>Data Policies</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          All four LHC experiments have approved data
          preservation and access policies which state that they will make their data
          (except level 4 data) available. New data will enter the portal once the
          embargo periods for them are over. For detailed information regarding
          embargo periods, accessibility and preservation of LHC data, please refer
          to the experimentsâ€™
          <a href="{{ url_for('invenio_collections.collection', name='Data-Policies') }}">data policies</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In support of these data policies, this portal
          publishes and preserves data from level 2 and 3, such as simplified formats
          and fully reconstructed events, together with associated software and
          documentation needed to access and use the data.

        <h4>How to re-use and cite these datasets</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
          All datasets and other material available in this
          portal are minted with a persistent identifier, a so called DOI (Digital
          Object Identifier) that allows permanent linking to the records. The CERN
          Open Data Portal endorses the <a href="http://www.force11.org/datacitation">
          FORCE 11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation </a>
          Principles. Thus, we ask you to cite the data provided in the portal when
          you re-use them. To make this easier for you, we provide you with a citation
          recommendation for every dataset as well as output formats (e.g. BibTex)
          for common reference programs. Citing datasets in the reference list of
          your paper will allow other platforms such as INSPIRE to track citations to
          these datasets and measure their impact.

      <h3>Technologies</h3>

      <p>
        This portal is built around the following technologies:
      </p>

    <div class="panel panel-primary">
      <div class="panel-heading">
        <h4 id="invenio">Invenio</h4>
      </div>

          <img class="aboutimg" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/opendata/invenio.png') }}" alt="" />
        </a>
        Invenio is a free software suite enabling you to run your own
        digital library or document repository on the web. The technology
        offered by the software covers all aspects of digital library
        management, from document ingestion through classification, indexing,
        and curation up to document dissemination. Invenio complies with
        standards such as the Open Archives Initiative and uses MARC 21 as its
        underlying bibliographic format. The flexibility and performance of
        Invenio make it a comprehensive solution for management of document
        repositories of moderate to large sizes.

        CernVM is a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of
        CERN LHC experiments. The Appliance represents a complete, portable and
        easy to configure user environment for developing and running LHC data
        analysis locally and on institutional and commercial clouds (OpenStack,
        Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine), independently of Operating System
        software and hardware platform (Linux, Windows, MacOS). The goal is to
        remove a need for the installation of the experiment software and to
        minimise the number of platforms (compiler-OS combinations) on which
        experiment software needs to be supported and tested.

        <p>
          EOS is a disk-based service providing a low latency storage
          infrastructure for physics users. EOS provides a highly-scalable
          hierarchical namespace implementation. Data access is provided by the
          XROOT protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main target area for the service are physics data analysis use
          often cases characterised by many concurrent users, a significant
          fraction random data access and a large file open rate.
